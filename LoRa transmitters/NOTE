Ensure that the libraries have been installed. The required ones are:
- LoRa (found in arduino library manager)
- SimpleDHT (found in arduino library manager)
- board_def.h (found in https://github.com/cubapp/LilyGO-TTGO-LoRa32-SenderReceiver/tree/master)

Be wary that "Lora_433" and "Lora_915" use two different board_def.h,
only one frequency can be set at a time, hence the separate header files.
